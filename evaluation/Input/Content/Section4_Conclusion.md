The final propofol PBPK model applies metabolism by UGT1A9,  CYP2B6 and glomerular filtration and adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of propofol in adults receiving intravenous bolus and continuous infusion of propofol ranging from 1 mg/kg to 36 mg/kg. 

This model could be applied for the investigation of drug-drug interactions (DDI), and translation to special populations such as pediatrics with regard to UGT1A1 and CYP2B6 metabolism.
