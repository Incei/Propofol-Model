The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for propofol in adults.

Propofol is an anaesthetic agent used for induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia. Propofol is only given intravenously and is mainly metabolized by Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9) (53-70%) [(Al-Jahdari 2006, Restrepo 2009](#5-references)). The final propofol model features metabolism by UGT1A9 and to a minor extent by Cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) [(Al-Jahdari 2006, Oda 2009](#5-references)). Additionally, there is excretion via glomerular filtration. The model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of propofol in adults.

The propofol model is a whole-body PBPK model, allowing for dynamic translation between individuals with organs expressing UGT1A9. The propofol report demonstrates the level of confidence in the propofol PBPK model build with the OSP suite with regard to reliable predictions of propofol PK adults during model-informed drug development.
